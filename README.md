Logz.io provides an automated deployment process to simplify the process of shipping logs from Azure Blob Storage.	
This integration forwards logs from your Azure Blob Storage	
to your Logz.io account.

<!-- tabContainer:start -->
<div class="branching-container">

## Deployment options:

* [Use your existing blob storage account](#existing-blob-config)
* [Create a new blob storage account](#new-blob-config)

These deployments will create the following services:
* Serverless Function App
* Application Insights
* App Service Plan
* Event Hubs Namespace
* Event Grid System Topic
* Storage account for the function's logs
* If you select the option to deploy a new account, a new Blob Storage account will be created as well.

<!-- tab:start -->
<div id="existing-blob-config">

# Use your existing blob storage account

**Before you begin, you'll need**:
A Blob storage account of the type **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)** . If your existing blob storage account is of any other kind, it will NOT work. Instead, follow the process to set up a new blob storage account.
Double-check your [_Storage accounts_](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2FStorageAccounts) to make sure that they are compatible. They should be of the type **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)**.

## Configure an automated deployment

ðŸ‘‡ Click this button to start the automated deployment.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flogzio%2Flogzio-azure-blob%2Fmaster%2Fdeployments%2FdeploymentTemplate.json)

You'll be taken to Azure,
where you'll configure the resources to be deployed.
Make sure to use the settings shown below.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Resource group* | Select your existing resource group, and then click **OK**. |
| Region* | Select the same region as the Azure services that will stream data to this Blob Storage. |
| Logzio host* | Use the listener URL specific to the region of your Logz.io account. You can look it up [here](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html). |
| Log shipping token* | Add the [log shipping token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/general) for the relevant Logz.io account. This is the account you want to ship to.  |
| Format* | Select one of the supported parsing formats: text/json/csv.  |
| Blob Storage Account Name* | Insert the name of the storage account that contains the logs.  |
| Buffersize (Default: 100) | The maximum number of messages the logger will accumulate before sending them all as a bulk.  |
| Timeout (Default: 180,000 = 3 minutes) | The read/write/connection timeout in *milliseconds*.  |

*Required fields  

At the bottom of the page, select **Review + Create**, and then click **Create** to deploy.  
Deployment can take a few minutes.

## Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana/discover?). 
Please note that only logs sent from this point on would be sent and appear under the type `blobStorage`.

If you still donâ€™t see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).

### Updating parameters after deployment

Some parameters can be updated post-deployment. These include:

* Shipper-related configurations: **LogzioHost**, **LogzioToken**, **Buffersize**, **Timeout**.
* **FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT** - maximum of 10. [See Microsoft documentation for more details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-app-settings#functions_worker_process_count).
* **ParseEmptyField** - Enable/disable the option to parse logs with invalid empty fields. This option exists to overcome a rare bug whereby the services ship unnamed fields that break the parsing pipeline. **Please consider enabling this option only if you encounter unparsed logs due to unnamed fields. Note that it may slow the shipper's performance.**

To update your parameters post-deployment, open the **Function App** page in your Azure portal. On the left menu, select the **Configuration** tab and edit the relevant values.
