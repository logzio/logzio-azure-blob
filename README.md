# Ship logs from Azure Blob Storage

To simplify shipping of your logs in Azure Blob Storage,
we provide an automated deployment process.

At the end of this process,
this integration will forward logs from Azure Blob Storage
to your Logz.io account.

<div class="tasklist">

### 1. Configure an automated deployment

👇 Click this button to start the automated deployment.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flogzio%2Flogzio-azure-blob%2Fmaster%2Fdeployments%2FdeploymentTemplateForNewStorage.json)

You'll be taken to Azure,
where you'll configure the resources to be deployed.
Make sure to use the settings shown below.

#### In the BASICS section

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Resource group | Click **Create new**. Give a meaningful **Name**, such as "logzioEventHubIntegration", and then click **OK**. |
| Location | Choose the same region as the Azure services that will stream data to this Event Hub. |

#### In the SETTINGS section

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Logs listener host | Use the listener URL for your logs account region. For more information on finding your account's region, see [Account region](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html). |
| Logs account token | Use the [token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/general) of the logs account you want to ship to. |
| Format (Default: text) | Choose one of the supported parsing formats: json/csv/text  |

At the bottom of the page, select **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**,
and then click **Purchase** to deploy.

Deployment can take a few minutes.

### 2. Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open Kibana.
If everything went according to plan, you should see logs with the type `blobStorage` in Kibana.

If you still don’t see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).

These are listed as "StorageV2" in the
[_Storage accounts_](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2FStorageAccounts)
