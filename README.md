# Ship logs from Azure Blob Storage

Logz.io provides an automated deployment process to simplify the process of shipping logs from Azure Blob Storage.	
This integration forwards logs from your Azure Blob Storage	
to your Logz.io account.

<div class="branching-container">

## Deployment options:

* [Use your existing blob storage account](#existing-blob-config)
* [Create a new blob storage account](#new-blob-config)

These deployments will create the following services:
* Serveless Function App
* Application Insights
* App Service Plan
* Event Hubs Namspace
* Event Grid System Topic
* Function's logs Storage Account
* Blob Storage Account (will be created only if you choose the second deploy option)

<div id="existing-blob-config">

## Use your existing blob storage account

**Before you begin, you'll need**:
a blob storage account of the type **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)** . If your existing blob storage account is of any other kind, it will NOT work. Instead, follow the process to set up a new blob storage account.
Double-check your [_Storage accounts_](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2FStorageAccounts) to make sure that they are compatible. They should be of the type **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)**.

### 1. Configure an automated deployment

ðŸ‘‡ Click this button to start the automated deployment.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flogzio%2Flogzio-azure-blob%2Fmaster%2Fdeployments%2FdeploymentTemplate.json)

You'll be taken to Azure,
where you'll configure the resources to be deployed.
Make sure to use the settings shown below.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Resource group* | Select your existing resource group, and then click **OK**. |
| Region* | Select the same region as the Azure services that will stream data to this Blob Storage. |
| Logzio host* | Use the listener URL specific to the region of your Logz.io account. You can look it up [here](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html). |
| Logzio token* | Add the [log shipping token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/general) for the relevant Logz.io account. This is the account you want to ship to.  |
| Format (Default: text) | Select one of the supported parsing formats: text/json/csv.  |
| Blob Storage Account Name | Insert the name of the storage account that contains the logs.  |
| Buffersize (Default: 100) | The maximum number of messages the logger will accumulate before sending them all as a bulk.  |
| Timeout (Default: 180,000 = 3 minutes) | The read/write/connection timeout in *milliseconds*.  |

*Required fields  

At the bottom of the page, agree to the terms and conditions. 
Then click **Purchase** to deploy.

Deployment can take a few minutes.

### 2. Add a blob container
In the
[_Storage accounts_](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2FStorageAccounts)
page, select the relevant StorageV2 account.

Click the **Containers** card to open it.

* If you don't yet have a blob container, build one now.
    
    Click **+ Container** in the toolbar. Give your container a meaningful **Name**, and select **Private** from the **Public access level** list. Press **OK** to create your container.

### 3. Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana/discover?). 
Please note that only logs sent from this point on would be sent and appear under the type `blobStorage`.

If you still donâ€™t see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
